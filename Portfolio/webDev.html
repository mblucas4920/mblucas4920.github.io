                        <p>Attached is a link to a website I created for a 
                            project in ITEC362 (Introduction to Web Systems) as well as two PDFs containing my 
                            initial wire frames sketch for the site, and a mock-UI I designed to base my website off of.</p>
                        <p>This project is a "fan-site" utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a stylish
                            and informative website that functions on most 
                            standard web browsers. The website is comprised of 15 different webpages, with 4 of them
                            acting as main features and the other 11 being used within an iFrame.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Before creating this website, I had never utilized wireframes or mock-UIs and they both
                            proved to be useful tools. Creating wireframes for my website made me consider the layout
                            of each webpage, as well as the navigation between each page. I designed the mock-UI using 
                            Figma and based it off my wireframes. This design became my main reference while coding the 
                            CSS for the website. This project taught me the importance of planning.
                        </p>
                        <p>Working on this project helped me enhance non-technical abilities as it required a great deal 
                            of time management, creative thinking, and a willingness to learn, alongside previous HTML
                            knowledge. This valuable experience will help in achieving my post-graduate goal of working
                            with a company that allows me to pursue my interest in website design and development.

                            This website is another one of my projects! Originally, I partially created a 
                            portfolio using <a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix.com</a>, but I wanted to
                            instead use this as an opportunity to practice what I've learned by coding
                            a portfolio website myself.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This website utilized HTML and CSS to create a visually pleasing and organized
                            website that functions on most standard web browsers. This website is comprised
                            of 7 different webpages. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I did not build WireFrames before coding this website, but I did use a mock UI
                            created using Wix to help determine the layout and design of the website.
