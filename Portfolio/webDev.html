                        <p>Attached is a link to a website I created for a 
                            project in ITEC362 (Introduction to Web Systems) as well as two PDFs containing my 
                            initial wire frames sketch for the site, and a mock-UI I designed to base my website off of.</p>
                        <p>This project is a "fan-site" utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a stylish
                            and informative website that functions on most 
                            standard web browsers. The website is comprised of 15 different webpages, with 4 of them
                            acting as main features and the other 11 being used within an iFrame.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Before creating this website, I had never utilized wireframes or mock-UIs and they both
                            proved to be useful tools. Creating wireframes for my website made me consider the layout
                            of each webpage, as well as the navigation between each page. I designed the mock-UI using 
                            Figma and based it off my wireframes. This design became my main reference while coding the 
                            CSS for the website. This project taught me the importance of planning.
                        </p>
                        <p>Working on this project helped me enhance non-technical abilities as it required a great deal 
                            of time management, creative thinking, and a willingness to learn, alongside previous HTML
                            knowledge. This valuable experience will help in achieving my post-graduate goal of working
                            with a company that allows me to pursue my interest in website design and development.

                            This website is another one of my projects! Originally, I partially created a 
                            portfolio using <a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix.com</a>, but I wanted to
                            instead use this as an opportunity to practice what I've learned by coding
                            a portfolio website myself.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This website utilized HTML and CSS to create a visually pleasing and organized
                            website that functions on most standard web browsers. This website is comprised
                            of 7 different webpages. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I did not build WireFrames before coding this website, but I did use a mock UI
                            created using Wix to help determine the layout and design of the website.

                        <h3>About Cola's Restaurant and Internship</h3>
                            <p>Cola's is a "casual" fine dining bar/restaurant located in Columbia, SC that specializes in seafood, steaks, and drinks. I worked as a 
                            Website Development Intern at Cola's Restaurant over the Summer of 2025. My duties and responsibilities included designing UI/UX prototypes,
                            creating and optimizing web content for seamless user experience & responsive design, evaluate website design and ensuring it aligned with brand standards/visual identity,
                            and more.
                            </p>
                        <h3>Phase 1: Planning</h3>
                            <p>At the beginning of my internship for Cola’s Restaurant I used Microsoft Project Planner to create a timeline for my project during my internship. </p>
                        <h3>Phase 2: Prototyping</h3>
                            <p>Over the course of my internship, I created both low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes.</p>
                            <strong>Low-Fidelity Prototypes</strong>
                                <p>The purpose of the following prototypes was to establish a layout for the website that my supervisor was satisfied 
                                with before beginning to design more details.</p>
                            <strong>High-Fidelity Prototypes</strong>
                                <p>The purpose of the following prototypes was to establish a color scheme, and content (text, images, links, etc.), alongside other details such as
                                    user interactivity and user accessibility. These high-fidelity prototypes worked as my main reference during the coding process.
                                </p>
                        <h3>Phase 3: Coding</h3>
                            <strong>Languages Used:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>HTML</li>
                                <li>CSS</li>
                                <li>JavaScript</li>
                            </ul>
                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                            <p>My time at Cola’s Restaurant was valuable and rewarding. My design was not made the restaurant’s official webpage during the length of my internship, but my work will be used and referenced in future projects for the company. The biggest difficulties I faced were in the following categories…</p>
                            <p>Communication. It was difficult at times to communicate with my supervisor due to the nature of his position (he is rarely on-site). This challenge was solved by me beginning to write weekly reports of my work and emailing them to my supervisor.</p>
                            <p>Responsive design. One of the most significant (technical) challenges I faced was ensuring that the website was responsive on both mobile and desktop devices. I solved this problem with extensive research, trial-and-error, and having access to many screen sizes.

                        <p>UofSC's Capstone course grants students experience through the practical
                            application of project management software, technologies, and practices to the design and implementation of real-world capstone projects.
                        </p>
                        <p>Our client, Dr. John Gerdes, requested we develop a PHP tutorial website handling both front-end and back-end development. 
                            The goal of this project is to provide an interactive learning platform that demonstrates how to use PHP to create and update web forms, 
                            as well as generate graphs from user-inputted data. The final product will serve as an educational resource for students learning PHP-based web development</p>
                        <p>
                            The web enabled database tutorial is built in PHP and hosted via XAMPP. The website exists as “PHP-MySQL-Tutorials” with fully implemented CSS. Another version exists as “PHP-MySQL-Tutorials-minCSS” with minimum CSS intended to only manage the basic layout of the websites content.
                        </p>
                        <p>The website contains the following webpages...
                            <ol>
                                <li>Index/Landing Page</li>

                        <p>This project was developed over the course of 8 weeks divided into 4 sprints (each 2 weeks in length).</p>
                        <h3>Sprint 1: Project Charter and Scope of Work (Jufura Media Unlimited)</h3>
                        <p>My group was unique in that we worked with two different clients over the course of 8 weeks. Our first client, Jufura Media Unlimited, took up the entirety of our
                            first sprint. These two weeks were spent communicating with our client to develop a satisfactory project schedule and a reasonable scope of work. Unfortunately, 
                            after many lengthy discussions with our client, we came to the conclusion that the requirements being asked of us were not possible for us to achieve with our 
                            current skill levels and within the short 8 week time frame. We mutually came to the decisiion to go our separate ways, and our group was then assigned to Dr. John Gerdes, who we spent the remaining 3 sprints working for.

                        <h3>Sprint 2: Low-Fidelity Prototype (Dr. John Gerdes)</h3>
                        <p>Our second sprint was spent communicating with Dr. Gerdes to establish a satsifactory project charter and statement of work. After each of these documents was signed 
                            by all group members and by our client, we officially began working on deliverables. During this sprint we designed a low-fidelity prototype (wireframes) to establish
                            the layout of the website and getting it approved before beginning to code. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>Sprint 3: ERDs and Alpha-Design Website</h3>
                        <p>Our third sprint was spent researching and writing content for the webpages, an designing entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) to reference when creating both the front-end
                            and the back-end of the website. The deliverables for this sprint included ERDs and an alpha-design of the website which features a semi-functional MySQL database, and 3 functional 
                            webpages. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>Sprint 4: Functional Website</h3>
                        <p>Our fourth and final sprint was spent developing CRUD queries and finalizing PHP/CSS code on the remaining webpages. The deliverables for this sprint included a fully 
                            functional tutorial website that is capable of successsfully teaching students how to utilize PHP and MySQL together. This website is capable of storing, updating, and displaying user-inputted data.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Conclusion: </h3>
                        <p>The Capstone course and project provided crucial real-world experience in a group setting. This project required a signifigant amount of planning, documentation,
                            communication, collaboration, and coding. In order to make the project more palatable, our group seperated into different roles. I was dubbed the "Development Technical Lead" 
                            due to my past in and passion for website development. I was responsible for bridging the gap between our clients goals, and the technical requirements needed by our team
                            to achieve said goals. I compiled our detailed project schedule, and did a majority of the front-end coding (PHP, HTML, CSS).
