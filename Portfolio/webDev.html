                        <p>Attached is a link to a website I created for a 
                            project in ITEC362 (Introduction to Web Systems) as well as two PDFs containing my 
                            initial wire frames sketch for the site, and a mock-UI I designed to base my website off of.</p>
                        <p>This project is a "fan-site" utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a stylish
                            and informative website that functions on most 
                            standard web browsers. The website is comprised of 15 different webpages, with 4 of them
                            acting as main features and the other 11 being used within an iFrame.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Before creating this website, I had never utilized wireframes or mock-UIs and they both
                            proved to be useful tools. Creating wireframes for my website made me consider the layout
                            of each webpage, as well as the navigation between each page. I designed the mock-UI using 
                            Figma and based it off my wireframes. This design became my main reference while coding the 
                            CSS for the website. This project taught me the importance of planning.
                        </p>
                        <p>Working on this project helped me enhance non-technical abilities as it required a great deal 
                            of time management, creative thinking, and a willingness to learn, alongside previous HTML
                            knowledge. This valuable experience will help in achieving my post-graduate goal of working
                            with a company that allows me to pursue my interest in website design and development.

                            This website is another one of my projects! Originally, I partially created a 
                            portfolio using <a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix.com</a>, but I wanted to
                            instead use this as an opportunity to practice what I've learned by coding
                            a portfolio website myself.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This website utilized HTML and CSS to create a visually pleasing and organized
                            website that functions on most standard web browsers. This website is comprised
                            of 7 different webpages. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I did not build WireFrames before coding this website, but I did use a mock UI
                            created using Wix to help determine the layout and design of the website.

                        <h3>About Cola's Restaurant and Internship</h3>
                            <p>Cola's is a "casual" fine dining bar/restaurant located in Columbia, SC that specializes in seafood, steaks, and drinks. I worked as a 
                            Website Development Intern at Cola's Restaurant over the Summer of 2025. My duties and responsibilities included designing UI/UX prototypes,
                            creating and optimizing web content for seamless user experience & responsive design, evaluate website design and ensuring it aligned with brand standards/visual identity,
                            and more.
                            </p>
                        <h3>Phase 1: Planning</h3>
                            <p>At the beginning of my internship for Colaâ€™s Restaurant I used Microsoft Project Planner to create a timeline for my project during my internship. </p>
                        <h3>Phase 2: Prototyping</h3>
                            <p>Over the course of my internship, I created both low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes.</p>
                            <strong>Low-Fidelity Prototypes</strong>
                                <p>The purpose of the following prototypes was to establish a layout for the website that my supervisor was satisfied 
                                with before beginning to design more details.</p>
                            <strong>High-Fidelity Prototypes</strong>
                                <p>The purpose of the following prototypes was to establish a color scheme, and content (text, images, links, etc.), alongside other details such as
                                    user interactivity and user accessibility. These high-fidelity prototypes worked as my main reference during the coding process.
                                </p>
                        <h3>Phase 3: Coding</h3>
                            <strong>Languages Used:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>HTML</li>
                                <li>CSS</li>
                                <li>JavaScript</li>
                            </ul>
                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                            <p>My time at Colaâ€™s Restaurant was valuable and rewarding. My design was not made the restaurantâ€™s official webpage during the length of my internship, but my work will be used and referenced in future projects for the company. The biggest difficulties I faced were in the following categoriesâ€¦</p>
                            <p>Communication. It was difficult at times to communicate with my supervisor due to the nature of his position (he is rarely on-site). This challenge was solved by me beginning to write weekly reports of my work and emailing them to my supervisor.</p>
                            <p>Responsive design. One of the most significant (technical) challenges I faced was ensuring that the website was responsive on both mobile and desktop devices. I solved this problem with extensive research, trial-and-error, and having access to many screen sizes.
