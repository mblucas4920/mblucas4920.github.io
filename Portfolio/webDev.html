                        <p>Attached is a link to a website I created for a 
                            project in ITEC362 (Introduction to Web Systems) as well as two PDFs containing my 
                            initial wire frames sketch for the site, and a mock-UI I designed to base my website off of.</p>
                        <p>This project is a "fan-site" utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a stylish
                            and informative website that functions on most 
                            standard web browsers. The website is comprised of 15 different webpages, with 4 of them
                            acting as main features and the other 11 being used within an iFrame.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Before creating this website, I had never utilized wireframes or mock-UIs and they both
                            proved to be useful tools. Creating wireframes for my website made me consider the layout
                            of each webpage, as well as the navigation between each page. I designed the mock-UI using 
                            Figma and based it off my wireframes. This design became my main reference while coding the 
                            CSS for the website. This project taught me the importance of planning.
                        </p>
                        <p>Working on this project helped me enhance non-technical abilities as it required a great deal 
                            of time management, creative thinking, and a willingness to learn, alongside previous HTML
                            knowledge. This valuable experience will help in achieving my post-graduate goal of working
                            with a company that allows me to pursue my interest in website design and development.

                            This website is another one of my projects! Originally, I partially created a 
                            portfolio using <a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix.com</a>, but I wanted to
                            instead use this as an opportunity to practice what I've learned by coding
                            a portfolio website myself.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This website utilized HTML and CSS to create a visually pleasing and organized
                            website that functions on most standard web browsers. This website is comprised
                            of 7 different webpages. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I did not build WireFrames before coding this website, but I did use a mock UI
                            created using Wix to help determine the layout and design of the website.

                        <h3>About Cola's Restaurant and Internship</h3>
                            <p>Cola's is a "casual" fine dining bar/restaurant located in Columbia, SC that specializes in seafood, steaks, and drinks. I worked as a 
                            Website Development Intern at Cola's Restaurant over the Summer of 2025. My duties and responsibilities included designing UI/UX prototypes,
                            creating and optimizing web content for seamless user experience & responsive design, evaluate website design and ensuring it aligned with brand standards/visual identity,
                            and more.
                            </p>
                        <h3>Phase 1: Planning</h3>
                            <p>At the beginning of my internship for Cola’s Restaurant I used Microsoft Project Planner to create a timeline for my project during my internship. </p>
                        <h3>Phase 2: Prototyping</h3>
                            <p>Over the course of my internship, I created both low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes.</p>
                            <strong>Low-Fidelity Prototypes</strong>
                                <p>The purpose of the following prototypes was to establish a layout for the website that my supervisor was satisfied 
                                with before beginning to design more details.</p>
                            <strong>High-Fidelity Prototypes</strong>
                                <p>The purpose of the following prototypes was to establish a color scheme, and content (text, images, links, etc.), alongside other details such as
                                    user interactivity and user accessibility. These high-fidelity prototypes worked as my main reference during the coding process.
                                </p>
                        <h3>Phase 3: Coding</h3>
                            <strong>Languages Used:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>HTML</li>
                                <li>CSS</li>
                                <li>JavaScript</li>
                            </ul>
                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                            <p>My time at Cola’s Restaurant was valuable and rewarding. My design was not made the restaurant’s official webpage during the length of my internship, but my work will be used and referenced in future projects for the company. The biggest difficulties I faced were in the following categories…</p>
                            <p>Communication. It was difficult at times to communicate with my supervisor due to the nature of his position (he is rarely on-site). This challenge was solved by me beginning to write weekly reports of my work and emailing them to my supervisor.</p>
                            <p>Responsive design. One of the most significant (technical) challenges I faced was ensuring that the website was responsive on both mobile and desktop devices. I solved this problem with extensive research, trial-and-error, and having access to many screen sizes.
