                            for ITEC352 (Software Design)</p>
                
                        <p>This project required for me to use the knowledge 
                            gained during the course to program a "Form" in Python. This form contains 1 "Entry" box,
                            5 "ComboBoxes," 1 "SpinBox," 8 "CheckBoxes," 1 "Read" button that loads
                            previously saved data, and 1 "Write" button that saves currently inputed data. Each of
                            these features were added using Tkinter. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The "Write" and "Read" buttons work by using functions to get or load user inputed
                            information. The write button creates and opens a file and inserts (or writes)
                            the user inputed data into it. The read button opens a previously saved file and 
                            inputs the data into the form.

                        <p>Attached is a PDF for a "Subscription Manager Application" LFP created by me and a group
                            of two other students for ITEC444 (Intro to Human Computer Interaction). This PDF file showcases
                            each page in our Figma design, and describes 10 design principles we used. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Within the PDF is a link to our Figma LFP design. This was a group assignment, but I was
                            responsible for every aspect of designing and creating the applications LFP and HFP.
                        </p>
                        <p>This project helped me understand how low-fidelity prototypes contribute to the early
                            stages of UI/UX design by providing a physical and/or visual representation of the
                            final product in a quick, cheap, and easily changed way. These prototypes allow for 
                            enhanced Communication, feedback, and reflection about a products design and functions.
                        </p>

                        <P>The high-fidelity prototype was made on Figma and built from the low-fidelity prototype. 
                            The biggest changes between the LFP and the HFP (other than the addition of graphics & further details) 
                            were changes to the navigation system. The “Home/Dashboard” navigation option was moved to the main footer, 
                            and the “Community” navigation option took its place in the drop-down navigation. 
                            This makes navigation smoother for users and improves their experience when using the interface. 
                            I also implemented more feedback in response to user input to make it clear to the user what action 
                            has been taken and what has been accomplished. ​
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Working on the Subscription Manager Application’s interface helped 
                            demonstrate the importance of prototyping in the design process, as 
                            well as the difference between low fidelity & high fidelity prototypes. 
                            Prototyping allows for designs to be tested and improved upon while designing, 
                            rather than after completing a full interface. Prototyping saves time and money by
                             prioritizing user functionality early in the design process. ​This project 
                             also provided experience designing and conducting user testing. 
                             This made me consider what our users need and expect from the application, 
                             and allowed for me to create an interface that adheres to those expectations. ​ 
                             This project also granted me experience in working with UI/UX design, 
                             specifically learning how to use Figma to create prototypes.
