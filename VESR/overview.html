                    Living in a capitalistic society during the height of the digital age means that there is more 
                    intellectual property being created than ever. Technology has revolutionized 
                    the way intellectual property is created, distributed, and consumed. In the world of IT, 
                    intellectual property is created, obtained, and used daily in numerous ways, including 
                    when creating new software or web applications. 
                    <br><br>When using the intellectual property of others 
                    (such as image, audio, or video files owned by outside sources) 
                    within your work it is important to consider the ethical and legal implications. 
                    A big ethical and legal concern is the use of others’ intellectual property without 
                    proper permission or compensation to those who own it. This can lead to severe consequences, 
                    including lawsuits over copyright infringement if not carefully considered and prevented.
                    <br><br>
                    For group 4's project, there are a lot of concerns that come with the acquisition and usage of music within the web application.
                    Intellectual property does not all fall under fair-use, 
                    especially not in use cases such as in the <a href="requirements.html">JMU web application </a>where it’s intended for public and commercial use.
                    Our group wants to avoid the <a href="caseStudy.html">legal troubles that Napster faced in 2001 </a>regarding copyright infringement and intellectual property rights.</a> 
                    One way to avoid Napster’s fate would be to acquire the <a href="repercussions.html">required sync and master use licenses</a> to legally and ethically source and use music within the JMU web application. 
                    Assuring that the work we are doing is both ethical and legal is a major step in this project.
