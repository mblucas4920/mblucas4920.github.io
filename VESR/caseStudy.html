                <h2>Napster</h2>
                <p class="textIndent">In 1999, a platform named Napster was created and released. Napster was intended to be a free peer-to-peer file sharing service, 
                    which allowed users to download compressed digital media files (MP3s) from other users’ libraries. 
                    The platform was wildly popular and reached over seventy-five million registered users during its peak, 
                    which was also when it began to catch the attention of music industry giants <a href="references.html">(Obermaier, 2019)</a>.

                <h2>A&M Records Lawsuit Against Napster</h2>
                <p class="textIndent">Seventy-five million is no insignificant number of people, and artists and their record labels began to notice that
                     they were losing sales on their intellectual property due to it being freely distributed between users via Napster. 
                     In 2001, A&M Records Inc., alongside eighteen other record companies, sued Napster. This lawsuit included many big names in the industry, 
                     including Metallica and Dr. Dre. The plaintiff argued that Napster willingly facilitated mass-scale copyright infringement by allowing its 
                     users to freely share audio files with one another.

                <h2>Napster's Counterargument and Case Outcome</h2>
                <p class="textIndent">Napster’s counterargument was that they were not responsible for the files shared by their users, 
                    and that since the music files were not stored within Napster’s own servers, they were not responsible for them. 
                    This argument, however, did not prove their innocence. The outcome ruled in favor of the plaintiff (the music industry),
                     and Napster was ordered to shut down operations in 2001 <a href="references.html">(Yellowbrick, 2023)</a>.</p>
