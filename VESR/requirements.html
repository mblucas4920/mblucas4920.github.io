                <h2>Client and Requirements</h2>
                <p>Group 4's initial client was Jufura Media Unlimited (JMU). Our client's product was focused on
                    on educating youth using music. The ethical concerns related to this project are due to the 
                    following project requirements.
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gather user data to create an aggregated list of the top 10 - 15 songs across users.</li>
                        <li>Download and cut the full-length licensed media into short instructional clips (specifically, four clips from each song, 30 seconds per clip).</li>
                        <li>Distribute the instructional clips to users.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    There are many ethical concerns regarding these project requirements. Downloading, editing, and distributing audio files without written legal permission 
                    from its owners can lead to copyright infringement, and end in lawsuits. This web application will not be for personal, private, or educational purposes. 
                    It will be accessible to the public, it is intended for commercial use, and the music would be acquired and distributed illegally. 
                    <br><br>All these things make it especially important to consider the ethical and legal repercussions of copyright infringement early in the project.
