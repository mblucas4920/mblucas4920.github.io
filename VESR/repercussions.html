            <h1>Ethical/Legal Repercussions and How to Avoid Them</h1>
        </header>
        <main>
            <p>Considering the ethical and legal repercussions of music acquisition and usage is important to avoid lawsuits and shutdowns such as what happened to Napster.
                One way to avoid these repercussions is by getting the required licenses to use music. When it comes to music licensing, 
                there are two main licenses that are needed...
            </p>
            <h3 class="textIndent">The first is the synchronization license, or the sync license.</h3>
            <p class="textIndent subIndent">This license grants permission to use the musical composition, but not the actual audio recording itself.</p>
            <p class="textIndent subIndent">A sync license gives the right to cover a song and use its musical composition, but not to use the original recording.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="textIndent">The second type of license required is the master use license.</h3>
            <p class="textIndent subIndent">This license grants the right to use the original song audio.</p>
            <p id="licenses">
                For the use of music within the JMU web application, both licenses would be required. Several music rights organizations such as SESAC, ASCAP, 
                and GMR can grant sync and master licenses, or provide contact information to a music publisher or record label that can grant those licenses
