            <div id="strategies">
                <div><h4>Fit with Strategy</h4>
                    <p>A performance management system should aim at achieving employee behavior and attitudes that support the organizationâ€™s strategy, goals, and culture.</p>
                </div>
                <div><h4>Validity</h4>
                    <p>The extent to which a measurement tool actually measures what it is intended to measure</p>
                </div>
                <div><h4>Reliability</h4>
                    <p>The consistency of the results that the performance measure will deliver.</p>
                </div>
                <div><h4>Acceptability</h4>
                    <p>Whether or not a measure is valid and reliable, it must meet the practical standard of being acceptable to the people who use it.</p>
                </div>
                <div><h4>Specific Feedback</h4>
                    <p>A performance measure should specifically tell employees what is expected of them and how they can meet those expectations.</p>
